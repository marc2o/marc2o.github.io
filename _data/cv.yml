  statement: |
    Linguist with a doctorate and language enthusiasm. My focus is on the means of visual communication, especially text, »icons« and illustrations aiding users to perform certain tasks (and make them want to do it). My intrinsic motivation is to make other people’s lives (as well as my own) easier and more comprehensible.
